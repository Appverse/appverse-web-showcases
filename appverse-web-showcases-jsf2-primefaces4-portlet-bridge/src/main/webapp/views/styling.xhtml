			There are two ways of loading CSS resources in a JSF2 view/composition:
			
			1. Using the HTML link element tag like this:
				<link href="#{request.contextPath}/css/foo.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"></link>
			
			2. Using the JSF2 h:outputStylesheet component tag like this:
				<h:outputStylesheet library="css" name="css" />
			
			The benefit of using #1:
			- The browser directly requests a resource from the server and does not invoke the JSF lifecycle.
			
			The benefits of using #2:
			- The CSS resource can use the #{resource['']} EL-expression inside it for images.
			- The href URL generated by the h:outputStylesheet renderer is compatible with WSRP.
			
			So #1 is always faster, but #2 is more flexible. This demo uses #2 simply for testing purposes.
