  <!-- Secured annotations are disabled. This is the simplest strategy to test your secured services which implies disable the security annotations.
       Take into account that with this solution you are testing the business services but not the security.
       If you want to test security in your services or you have role dependant methods, consider to implement an @Before annotated method in your
       JUnit tests injecting the security context you require in every case. You can implement a "logout" method in the @After annotated method.
